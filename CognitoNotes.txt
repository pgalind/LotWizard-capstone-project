- AWS service that offers Authn and authz
- keep active user directory, secure api's, provide temp access

User Pools
	- Pool of users
	- App -> authenticate + get tokens -> user pool -> sign in
	- Can integrate other social sign ons with Cognito in our user pool
Identity Pools
	- Provide short term access to AWS services
	- app -> login provider -> cognito -> SWS

*Can tag attributes in user pools with roles
	-Ex in identity pool if user is tagged w admin role we can sign in with admin privileges

- Can keep track if email or phone # has been verified

Flow
User auth -> Cognito sends back tokens -> We have to send those tokens to our backend
and examine them to validate they are correct

Can have cognito triggers too using Lambda funcs

Integrate w next.js

-use next-auth js. Authentication library within next.js
