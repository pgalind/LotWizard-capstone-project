Our team is building a website. We will be using the React library, coupled with the next.js framework running on top of the node.js runtime environment to conveniently represent our front-end. React is known for being able to elegantly construct large portions of a web document while only relying on reusable, simplified code.

I studied the theory of node.js, in it's role in the industry as well as its runtime system capabilities:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explain-the-working-of-node-js/#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20used%20as,fast%2C%20and%20data%2Dintensive.

I installed it by following installation documentation, additionally taking note of how it interacts with other frameworks such as Express.js for reference:

I followed a youtube tutorial showing an example of how one would build a website using node.js alongside Next.js, Tailwind and MongoDB
